NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Static::Simple - Make serving static pages painless.

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst;
        MyApp->setup( qw/Static::Simple/ );
    
DESCRIPTION
    The Static::Simple plugin is designed to make serving static content in
    your application during development quick and easy, without requiring a
    single line of code from you.

    It will detect static files used in your application by looking for file
    extensions in the URI. By default, you can simply load this plugin and
    it will immediately begin serving your static files with the correct
    MIME type. The light-weight MIME::Types module is used to map file
    extensions to IANA-registered MIME types.

    Note that actions mapped to paths using periods (.) will still operate
    properly.

    You may further tweak the operation by adding configuration options,
    described below.

CONFIGURATION
    Configuration is completely optional and is specified within
    MyApp->config->{static}.

    Define a list of top-level directories beneath your 'root' directory
    that should always be served in static mode. Regular expressions may be
    specified using qr//.

        MyApp->config->{static}->{dirs} => [
            'static',
            qr/^(images|css)/,
        ]
    
    To override or add to the default MIME types set by the MIME::Types
    module, you may enter your own extension to MIME type mapping.

        MyApp->config->{static}->{mime_types} => {
            jpg => 'images/jpg',
            png => 'image/png',
        }    
    
    Enable additional debugging information printed in the Catalyst log.
    This is automatically enabled when running Catalyst in -Debug mode.

        MyApp->config->{static}->{debug} => 1
